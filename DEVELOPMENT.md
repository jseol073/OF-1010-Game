So far, I made a Block class that represent each block of the pieces and the grid. So, there are 7 subclasses from the Block class which specify what image to use to represent the block.
Also, I made a Piece class which has 6 subclasses for the 6 different pieces of the game, and the pieces are consisted of the Block objects.
I also made a Grid class that displays the 10 x 10 grid on the window.
I library used is ofImage to display the pieces and the grid as an image which I have downloaded on my computer.
