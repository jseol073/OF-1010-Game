# CS 126 FinalProject
My final project is a clone of the game 1010!, using Openframeworks, which is a single player game that can be found in android/ios devices.

Rules of 1010! :
A player can click and drag a piece on the 10x10 grid. 
Each piece added on the grid adds points to the score depending on how many blocks the piece is constisted of.
(Red: 2 points, Light Green: 4 points, Green: 3 points, Blue: 9 points, Orange: 3 points)

Example of pieces getting stacked:

The goal of this game is to stack up those pieces such that a row or column gets filled with block which gives 10 points to the user.

The player keeps playing until the grid has no room for another piece which means the player has no moves left.

Example of losing:

The player can click the reset button to start a new game and also can  click the leaderboard button which displayes the highest scores up to 10 games.
