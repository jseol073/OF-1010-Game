# CS 126 FinalProject
My final project is a clone of the game 1010!, using Openframeworks, which is a single player game that can be found in android/ios devices.

Rules of 1010! :
A player can click and drag a piece on the 10x10 grid. 
Each piece added on the grid adds points to the score depending on how many blocks the piece is constisted of.
(Red: 2 points, Light Green: 4 points, Green: 3 points, Blue: 9 points, Orange: 3 points)

The goal of this game is to stack up those pieces such that a row or column gets filled with block which gives 10 points to the user.

The player keeps playing until there is no room for another piece which means the player has no moves left.
