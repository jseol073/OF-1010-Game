# Project Proposal
For my final project, I would like to create a tetris game through ofxGui on openFrameworks.
So, I am first planning to make a grid that is resized by the rules of the game which can implemented by the methods from **ofxPanel.h**.
I would also make different block objects that represent the 6 different pieces and they would be generated by the draw methods from **ofxGui.h** or **ofxLabel.h**.
During the game, there would be stats on the level and points which means I would have to use **ofxLabel.h**.
Possibly, I'll add a **slider** that configures the difficulty and/or the pace of the game.
A lot of keyboard buttons will be used which means methods from **ofxButtons.h**.
I'm also planning to add music in the background which uses **ofSoundPlayer**.
Moreover, I'm implementing some sort of leaderboard similar to this weeks assignment.
