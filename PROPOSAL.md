# Project Proposal
For my final project, I would like to create a tetris game through ofxGui on openFrameworks.
So, I am first planning to make a grid that is resized by the rules of the game which can implemented by the methods from **ofxPanel.h**.
I would also make different block objects that represent the 6 different pieces and they would be generated by the draw methods from **ofxGui.h** or **ofxLabel.h**.
During the game, there would be stats on the level and points which means I would have to use **ofxLabel.h**.
Possibly, I'll add a **slider** that configures the difficulty and/or the pace of the game.
A lot of keyboard buttons will be used which means methods from **ofxButtons.h**.
I'm also planning to add music in the background which uses **ofSoundPlayer**.
Moreover, I'm implementing some sort of leaderboard similar to this weeks assignment.

EDIT:
I decided to make slight changes to my project. I'm planning to make a clone of 1010! which is a game similar to tetris so half of the process of this project will be basically identical if I still chose to do tetris. The differences are that the pieces will be clicked and dragged by the mouse instead of them being dropped down by the keyboard keys, and that the grid will be 10 x 10 instead of 20 X 10. 
So, the libraries I mentioned previously will all still be used in addition to the click and drag libraries for the mouse.
